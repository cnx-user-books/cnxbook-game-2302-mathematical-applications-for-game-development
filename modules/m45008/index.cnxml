Everyone is familiar with the acceleration that occurs when a motor vehicle 
speeds up or slows down. When the vehicle speeds up very rapidly, the positive 
acceleration forces us against the back of the seat. (This involves the 
relationship among force, mass, and acceleration, which will be the subject of a 
future module.)

The exercises in the remainder of this module are based on the following two 
assumptions:

</para>




<list id="ul1009" list-type="bulleted">

	

<item id="li1042">
For practical purposes, the effect of the acceleration of gravity is the same 
	regardless of the height of an object above the surface of the earth, 
	provided that the distance above the surface of the earth is small relative 
	to the radius of the earth.

</item>


	

<item id="li1043">
In the absence of an atmosphere, all objects fall toward the earth with 
	the same acceleration regardless of their masses.

<para id="p1039">
Let's examine the validity of these two assumptions.

This

law

</link>

 
states that every point mass in the universe attracts every other point mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. (Separately it 
has been shown that large spherically symmetrical masses attract and are attracted as if all their mass were concentrated at their centers.)

Effect of gravity versus altitude

</emphasis>
</para>




<para id="p1043">
An object at the surface of the earth is approximately 3963 miles from the 
center of the earth. An object that is six miles above the surface of the earth 
(typical flying altitude for a passenger plane) is approximately 3969 miles from 
the center of the earth.

</para>




<para id="p1044">
Therefore, (if I didn't make an arithmetic error) the gravitational 
attraction between the earth and that object changes by less than 0.5 percent 
when the object is transported from the surface of the earth to a position that 
is six miles above the surface of the earth.

gravity is constant up to at least 32000 feet above the surface of the earth.

Instead, for any practical value of initial velocity (neglecting air 
resistance), gravitational attraction will eventually cause the arrow to slow

At about 3 seconds and a height of about 161 feet, the kinetic energy

Measuring variable velocity in the real world

<para id="p1098">
Measuring variable velocity in the real world can be difficult. What you need 
to do is to measure the displacement of an object in as short a time interval as 
possible and then divide the displacement by the value of the time interval. If 
you can do this at enough points in time, you can construct curves that 
represent the variable velocity to which the object is being subjected.

<para id="p1100">
Assuming that you are able to create a plot of displacement versus time 
	at closely-spaced points, you can estimate the variable velocity curve by 
	connecting each pair of points with a straight line and measuring the slope 
	of each such straight line segment. An estimate of the velocity during the interval 
	defined by a pair of points is the slope of the line that connects those 
	points. The closer the points are, the better will be the estimate of the 
	velocity at a point half way between those two points.

</para>




<para id="p1101">
In the situation where you are able to collect enough data to draw a smooth 
curve of displacement versus time, the instantaneous velocity at any point on 
that curve is the slope of a line that is tangent to the curve at that point. 
Note, however, that the construction of such a tangent line is difficult.

If may recall from your high school geometry course that the

At 3.25 seconds, the velocity switches from positive to negative meaning 
	that the arrow begins falling back toward the earth. The velocity reaches 
	-100 feet/second somewhere between 6.25 and 6.5 seconds, which is about the 
	same time that the arrow hits the ground.

</para>




<para id="p1128">
Hopefully you have recognized that the velocity curve for 
this particular situation is a straight line with a negative slope. That 
straight line crosses the horizontal axis going from positive territory into 
negative territory about half way between the original release of the arrow and 
the point where the arrow strikes the ground.
